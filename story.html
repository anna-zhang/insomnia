                <p>“Mr. Turner? Matt Turner?”</p>
                <p>
                    Matt startled awake at the nurse’s voice. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/diagnosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Always sleepy</a>, he had nodded off again even though it was only half-past noon—his head had slumped against the bland beige wallpaper of the waiting room only a few minutes after sitting down. He rubbed his bleary eyes, wiped his beard clean of any drool, and cleared his throat with a gruff cough.
                </p>
                <p>“Here, sorry.”</p>
                <p>The nurse fixed him with a gaze stuck somewhere between sympathy and pity.</p>
                <p>“Not at all. Right this way, Mr. Turner.”</p>
                <p>
                    With a yawn, Matt braced his hands against his knees, swayed to his feet, and followed Nurse Evans through the door into the sleep clinic. He couldn’t help but think as he settled once again in the exam room that a few more minutes of sleep couldn’t hurt.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="part-2" style="display: none;">
                <p>
                    Matt hadn’t always been tired, but somewhere between the new alternating night shifts thrown into his schedule and his wife Sarah’s cancer diagnosis, he had forgotten how to sleep. Coming home from a week on the road, he’d shower and crash in bed, but could never fall asleep. He just stared at the ceiling, his heart thumping fast in his chest and thoughts of <i>Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,</i> who lay fast asleep next to him, racing through his mind. He kept setting aside more and more time to sleep, getting in bed at 9 p.m., then 8 p.m., then 7 p.m. But it never helped. He always gave up after a few hours of lying awake in the dark. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Matt would sneak out of bed to not wake Sarah, throw on his robe, and shuffle in the dark to the living room. Not quite awake but not quite asleep, he’d flick on the TV and watch George Lopez re-runs until he fitfully dozed off in his worn-out recliner that hurt his neck. At 6 a.m., his alarm would screech until he tumbled out of the recliner to turn it off. A cold shower and three cups of coffee later, Matt would shut the door quietly on his way to work, dawn just now stretching her arms over her head and yawning awake, pinks and oranges and yellows spilling onto the horizon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Matt stopped appreciating the beauty of the sunrise long ago. He felt bitter and angry most of the time, frustrated and at a loss as to what to do. He hated the new tiredness, the kind that sank bone-deep—heavy and ever-present like it made up its mind on staying and would never really go away. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He could understand now how tired his dad must have been before he passed away. A trucker, too, his father had often dozed off when he should have been awake. On Christmas mornings, he’d slump asleep in his chair as the kids opened presents. On Matt’s 9th birthday, he dozed off and face-planted into a piece of chocolate cake. On Matt’s high school graduation, he remembered looking out into the crowd, finding his mom wiping tears of joy and his dad tipped over dead asleep. <i>You can sleep when you’re dead, Matt, sleep when you’re dead,</i> Matt’s father always said, never seeming to catch the irony. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes, he understood all too well what that was like, falling asleep in the break room, in the bathroom, on the side of the road when he pulled the truck over. It worried him sometimes—how dead <i>tired</i> he was—but he paid it no mind. As long as he was awake at the wheel, it didn’t matter. But he fell asleep at the wheel. Matt didn’t remember dozing off, but he shot up awake when he heard the blare of the car horn, screaming at him. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Headlights glared at him straight on from the mirror—<a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/10/zsy144/5067408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he had drifted into the other lane</a>. 
                </p>
                <p><i>Crap, crap, crap.</i></p>
                <p>
                    Matt yanked the wheel to the right and swerved just in time. The truck, all 80,000 pounds of it packed full with cargo, careened off the asphalt into the grass. It screeched to a halt, trampling bluebonnets and sunflowers and prairie blossoms under its massive wheels. For a moment, Matt sat still, shocked, and horrified. He took a breath, re-started the ignition, and guided the behemoth back onto the asphalt. His hands wouldn’t stop trembling as he drove to the depot. When he got home, he sat down at the computer and Googled “I can’t sleep help.” The next morning, he called Dr. Simons’s office and made an appointment.

                <p>“Mr. Turner?”</p>
                <p>For the second time that afternoon, Matt woke to Nurse Evans’s voice.</p>
                <p>“Dr. Simons will be with you shortly.”</p>
                <p>A few minutes later, Dr. Simons entered the room.</p>
                <p>“So, tell me a bit about what’s bringing you in today, Matt.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t know—I just feel like I can’t get to sleep.”</p>
                <p>“Alright. How long have you been struggling with this?”</p>
                <p>“A few months or so.”</p>
                <p>“Well, let’s see what we can do for you, Matt. Did you finish filling out the sleep log we asked you to fill out this past week?”</p>
                <p>“Yes. I have it right here.”</p>
                <p>“Let’s have a look.” Dr. Simons paused to skim the chart, looking to make a <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/insomnia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tentative diagnosis</a>. “I see it’s taking you about 2-3 hours to fall asleep each night. Lots of nighttime awakenings. You’re having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep then?”</p>
                <p>Matt nods.</p>
                <p>“Alright. How are you feeling during the day?”</p>
                <p>“Tired and irritable and just plain awful.”</p>
                <p>“Sudden outburst or anything like that?”</p>
                <p>“Yes, at work, at home.”</p>
                <p>“Okay. How’s your performance at work? Are you staying awake? Falling asleep?”</p>
                <p>“Lately I doze off a lot on the road.”</p>
                <p>“I see. Have you struggled with anything like this before? Anybody in your family?”</p>
                <p>“No, not really, but I think my dad did.”</p>
                <p>
                    “Okay, well, bad news is you’ve got a textbook case of insomnia. You just can’t seem to get the rest you need. <a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbti/assets/user-content/documents/What%20help%20to%20people%20with%20insomnia%20seek%20--%202006_Sleep%20Med_Morin_et_al%20.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s common</a>. You can develop it from a stressful event or other factors in your background, and you can make it worse with some bad habits. Good news is that we know how to manage it, and we can help you out with this. Alright?”
                </p>
                <p>“Alright.”</p>
                <p>
                    “I want to see you here again next week, okay? I want you to keep tracking your sleep in this sleep log so we can get a better picture of exactly what’s going on. In the meantime, I’d like to put you in touch with a colleague of mine Dr. Roberts. She’s a cognitive behavioral therapist. A wonderful, wonderful lady, okay? I know she’ll be able to help you out.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Thank you, thank you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Matt shook Dr. Simons hand, for the first time in a long time, he felt something like hope.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="part-4" style="display: none;">
                <p><i>These techniques have helped others. They will help me.</i></p>
                <p>
                    Matt reminded himself of what Dr. Roberts had said during their therapy session.
                </p>
                <p><i>I can and will improve my sleep over time.</i></p>
                <p>
                    Matt took a deep breath and settled in bed next to his wife. Desperate, Matt immediately started employing the tips Dr. Roberts had recommended. Perhaps taking her advice to the extreme, he unplugged the TV in the living room before going to bed so that he wouldn’t be tempted to watch George Lopez re-runs. Though he’d never considered himself a big reader, he’d picked up a cheesy mystery novel on the way home to read if he woke up in the middle of the night. And, he listened to her advice on “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4294319/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sleep restriction</a>.” Instead of getting in bed hours before he’d actually fall asleep, he waited until 10 p.m. to get into bed, giving him eight hours to sleep before he had to be up at 6 a.m.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At first, he didn’t notice much of a difference, but when looking back at his sleep logs, he could see as the weeks went by his sleep duration getting longer and longer and his sleep onset latency, how long it took him to fall asleep, getting small and smaller. More importantly, he felt more awake and alive. He felt like he could be there for his wife Sarah, but he also learned how to be there for himself. When it was hard, he learned how to ask for help. Through Dr. Roberts, he found another therapist to speak to about the anxiety he had around his wife’s condition—his fear every night that, in the morning when he woke up, Sarah might be gone. And, when Sarah herself struggled to sleep at night, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15675652/#:~:text=Insomnia%20affects%20up%20to%2050,such%20as%20pain%20and%20fatigue." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as many cancer patients do</a>, he had the skills to help her, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Matt woke up feeling well-rested one frosty December morning after a full eight hours of sleep, he turned and kissed Sarah on the cheek. Her treatment had been going well, and his sleep treatment had, too. She might even be entering remission soon. He knew, for the first time in a long while, that everything would be okay.
