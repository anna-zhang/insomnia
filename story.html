            <p>“Mr. Turner? Matt Turner?”</p>
            <p>
                Matt startled awake at the nurse’s voice. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/diagnosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Always sleepy</a>, he had nodded off again even though it was only half-past noon—his head had slumped against the bland beige wallpaper of the waiting room only a few minutes after sitting down. He rubbed his bleary eyes, wiped his beard clean of any drool, and cleared his throat with a gruff cough.
            </p>
            <p>“Here, sorry.”</p>
            <p>The nurse fixed him with a gaze stuck somewhere between sympathy and pity.</p>
            <p>“Not at all. Right this way, Mr. Turner.”</p>
            <p>
                With a yawn, Matt braced his hands against his knees, swayed to his feet, and followed Nurse Evans through the door into the sleep clinic. He couldn’t help but think as he settled once again in the exam room that a few more minutes of sleep couldn’t hurt.
            </p>

        <div id="part-2">
            <p>
                Matt hadn’t always been tired, but somewhere between the new alternating night shifts thrown into his schedule and his wife Sarah’s cancer diagnosis, he had forgotten how to sleep. Coming home from a week on the road, he’d shower and crash in bed, but could never fall asleep. He just stared at the ceiling, his heart thumping fast in his chest and thoughts of <i>Sarah, Sarah, Sarah,</i> who lay fast asleep next to him, racing through his mind. He kept setting aside more and more time to sleep, getting in bed at 9 p.m., then 8 p.m., then 7 p.m. But it never helped. He always gave up after a few hours of lying awake in the dark. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Matt would sneak out of bed to not wake Sarah, throw on his robe, and shuffle in the dark to the living room. Not quite awake but not quite asleep, he’d flick on the TV and watch George Lopez re-runs until he fitfully dozed off in his worn-out recliner that hurt his neck. At 6 a.m., his alarm would screech until he tumbled out of the recliner to turn it off. A cold shower and three cups of coffee later, Matt would shut the door quietly on his way to work, dawn just now stretching her arms over her head and yawning awake, pinks and oranges and yellows spilling onto the horizon.
            </p>
            <p>
                But Matt stopped appreciating the beauty of the sunrise long ago. He felt bitter and angry most of the time, frustrated and at a loss as to what to do. He hated the new tiredness, the kind that sank bone-deep—heavy and ever-present like it made up its mind on staying and would never really go away. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He could understand now how tired his dad must have been before he passed away. A trucker, too, his father had often dozed off when he should have been awake. On Christmas mornings, he’d slump asleep in his chair as the kids opened presents. On Matt’s 9th birthday, he dozed off and face-planted into a piece of chocolate cake. On Matt’s high school graduation, he remembered looking out into the crowd, finding his mom wiping tears of joy and his dad tipped over dead asleep. <i>You can sleep when you’re dead, Matt, sleep when you’re dead,</i> Matt’s father always said, never seeming to catch the irony. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, he understood all too well what that was like, falling asleep in the break room, in the bathroom, on the side of the road when he pulled the truck over. It worried him sometimes—how dead <i>tired</i> he was—but he paid it no mind. As long as he was awake at the wheel, it didn’t matter. But he fell asleep at the wheel. Matt didn’t remember dozing off, but he shot up awake when he heard the blare of the car horn, screaming at him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Headlights glared at him straight on from the mirror—<a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/10/zsy144/5067408" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he had drifted into the other lane</a>. 
            </p>
            <p><i>Crap, crap, crap.</i></p>
            <p>
                Matt yanked the wheel to the right and swerved just in time. The truck, all 80,000 pounds of it packed full with cargo, careened off the asphalt into the grass. It screeched to a halt, trampling bluebonnets and sunflowers and prairie blossoms under its massive wheels. For a moment, Matt sat still, shocked, and horrified. He took a breath, re-started the ignition, and guided the behemoth back onto the asphalt. His hands wouldn’t stop trembling as he drove to the depot. When he got home, he sat down at the computer and Googled “I can’t sleep help.” The next morning, he called Dr. Simons’s office and made an appointment.
